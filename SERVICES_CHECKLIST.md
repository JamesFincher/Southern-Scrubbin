## Implementation Overview
Convert three stacked service sections into a single tabbed container with:
- 3 tabs: Homes | Airbnb/STR | Small Offices
- Each tab contains: Summary + "What's included" accordion + Add-ons/Not offering drawers

## Core Implementation Tasks

### Tab Structure Setup
- [ ] **Create Tab Container**: Implement accessible tab component
- [ ] **Three Tab Headers**: "Homes", "Airbnb / Short-Term Rental", "Small Offices"
- [ ] **Tab Panel Structure**: Each tab has its own content panel
- [ ] **Accessibility**: role="tablist", role="tab", aria-controls, aria-selected
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Left/right arrow keys between tabs
- [ ] **Active State Styling**: Clear visual indication of active tab

### Tab Content - Summaries
Add exact summaries (â‰¤45 words each):

#### Homes Tab
- [ ] **Summary Text**: "Kitchens, baths, bedrooms, living areas, and floorsâ€”kept tidy and comfortable. I stick to the plan we set and show up when I say I will. Straightforward communication and a clean you can count on."

#### Airbnb/STR Tab  
- [ ] **Summary Text**: "Guestâ€‘ready turns with sanitizing touchpoints, fresh linens and towels, light restock when supplies are onâ€‘site, and quick photo check on request. Sameâ€‘day turns when I can fit them."

#### Small Offices Tab
- [ ] **Summary Text**: "Cozy workspaces like private practices or small suites. Clear common surfaces, restrooms and break area, floors, and trash/recycling. Afterâ€‘hours possible for suites."

### "What's Included" Accordions
Implement accordion within each tab (same content across all tabs):

- [ ] **Accordion Component**: Collapsible panels with proper ARIA
- [ ] **Three Panels**: Kitchens | Bathrooms | Bedrooms & Living Areas
- [ ] **Button Headers**: Use buttons for accessibility
- [ ] **aria-expanded**: Toggle attribute on expand/collapse
- [ ] **aria-controls**: Connect header to panel ID

#### Panel Content (exact copy)
- [ ] **Kitchens Panel**: "Counters â€¢ Sink/faucet â€¢ Cabinet fronts â€¢ Microwave interior â€¢ Appliance exteriors â€¢ Floors"
- [ ] **Bathrooms Panel**: "Toilets â€¢ Tubs/showers â€¢ Sinks/vanity â€¢ Mirrors â€¢ Floors"  
- [ ] **Bedrooms & Living Panel**: "Dust reachable surfaces â€¢ Tidy â€¢ Floors"

### Add-ons Drawer/Modal
- [ ] **Trigger Button**: "Add-ons" or similar in each tab
- [ ] **Drawer/Modal Component**: Overlay or slide-out panel
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Focus trap, ESC closes, return focus to trigger
- [ ] **Intro Text**: "Ask ahead so I can plan enough time."
- [ ] **Chip Layout**: Chips for each add-on service

#### Add-ons Content (exact copy)
- [ ] **Add-on Chips**: "Inside oven Â· Inside fridge Â· Interior windows (reachable) Â· Baseboards/detail dusting Â· Light wall spotâ€‘cleaning Â· Laundry fold (your detergent) Â· Dish washâ€‘up"

### "Not Currently Offering" Drawer/Modal
- [ ] **Trigger Link**: "Not currently offering" or similar
- [ ] **Same Modal/Drawer Pattern**: Consistent with add-ons

#### Not Offering Content (exact copy)
- [ ] **Exclusion Chips**: "Carpet shampoo/extraction Â· Postâ€‘construction debris Â· Tallâ€‘ladder/roof work Â· Severe hoarding Â· Active pest issues Â· Mold/biohazard Â· Exterior windows"

## Layout & Responsive Design

### Desktop Layout
- [ ] **Horizontal Tabs**: Tab headers in horizontal row
- [ ] **Multi-Column Lists**: 2-3 columns for "What's included" bullets to reduce scroll
- [ ] **Proper Spacing**: Maintain brand spacing standards
- [ ] **Width Constraints**: Appropriate max-width for readability

### Mobile Layout  
- [ ] **Responsive Tabs**: Tabs work well on mobile (stacked or scrollable)
- [ ] **Single Column**: Bullet lists in single column
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for tab headers and buttons
- [ ] **Drawer Behavior**: Modals/drawers appropriate for mobile

## Technical Requirements

### Accessibility
- [ ] **Tab ARIA**: Complete tab pattern implementation
- [ ] **Accordion ARIA**: Proper accordion accessibility
- [ ] **Modal ARIA**: Focus management and keyboard interaction
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy within tabs
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Clear announcements for state changes

### Performance
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy loading tab content
- [ ] **Animation Performance**: Smooth transitions without jank
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Efficient component organization

### Integration
- [ ] **Navigation**: #services anchor still works
- [ ] **Styling**: Matches existing brand theme
- [ ] **Animations**: Preserve any existing sparkle effects in section

## Testing & Validation

### Functionality

- [ ] **Accordion Expand**: All panels expand/collapse
- [ ] **Drawer/Modal**: Add-ons and exclusions open/close properly
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility

### Content Verification
